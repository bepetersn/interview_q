# Future Directions and Concerns

This document outlines potential areas for improvement, future enhancements, and key concerns for the Interview Questions App, based on current design and best practices.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Authentication & Security
- Add user authentication (e.g., JWT, session-based) to support multi-user scenarios and protect user data.
- Ensure imported and created data is scoped to the correct user.

### 2. Error Feedback & User Experience
- Standardize error feedback in the frontend (e.g., toast notifications, inline messages) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Consider adding onboarding flows or help tips for new users, especially for the import feature.

### 3. Import API & Background Processing
- Build the import API endpoints for pulling logs from coding platforms (this feature is not implemented yet).
- Implement background job infrastructure so long-running imports can run asynchronously.
- Add rate limiting to avoid timeouts and external API bans.

### 4. Frontend State Management
- If the app grows, introduce a global state manager (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or React Context) for better scalability and maintainability.

### 5. Frontend Testing
- Add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the frontend (e.g., with Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress) to improve reliability.

### 6. Accessibility
- Ensure all UI components are accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast) for inclusivity.

### 7. API Documentation
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the backend API to help frontend and third-party consumers.

### 8. Deployment & CI/CD
- Document or automate deployment (e.g., Docker, GitHub Actions) for consistent and reliable releases.

### 9. Data Privacy
- Clarify how user data is stored, used, and deleted, especially for imported data. Add a privacy policy if the app is public-facing.

## Planned Enhancements

- Support for additional coding platforms in the import API.
- More advanced filtering, search, and analytics in the frontend.
- Improved admin and moderation tools for managing questions and logs.
- Enhanced user profile and progress tracking features.

Addressing these areas will help ensure the application remains robust, scalable, and user-friendly as it evolves.
