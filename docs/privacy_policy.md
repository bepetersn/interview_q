This document explains how question data and activity logs are stored, retained and deleted within the Interview Questions App.

## Data Storage

All question, tag and log information is persisted in the application's relational database (SQLite by default). Access to these records is restricted to authenticated users via the API. Application logs generated by Django are written to the console according to the logging configuration in `backend/settings.py`.

## Retention

Data remains in the database until explicitly removed. The project does not currently implement automatic data expiration. Activity logs and questions you create are therefore retained indefinitely unless you delete them through the provided API endpoints.

## Deletion

The backend exposes REST endpoints for deleting data:

- `DELETE /api/questions/<id>/` – remove a question and all related `QuestionLog` entries (cascading delete)
- `DELETE /api/questionlogs/<id>/` – remove a single question log
- `DELETE /api/tags/<id>/` – remove a tag

These endpoints are exercised in the unit tests under `backend/core/tests` to ensure they function correctly. When you invoke these endpoints, the associated records are permanently removed from the database.
