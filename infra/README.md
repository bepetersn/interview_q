# Infrastructure Notes

The contents of the `infra/` directory, including CDK, SQS, and Lambda usage, are currently planned for future development and are **not yet functional**. Please refer to the project documentation for updates on infrastructure progress.

- `sqs_lambda_stack.py`, `lambda/handler.py`, and related files are placeholders for planned AWS infrastructure.
- No production infrastructure is deployed from this directory at this time.

For more information, see `docs/infra_design.md` and other documentation files.
